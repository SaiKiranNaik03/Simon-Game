            <h2>Rules:</h2>
            <p>The Simon game is a classic memory game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. <b>Here are the rules:</b></p>
            <p><b>Start of the Game:</b>The game begins by lighting up one of the four colors (red, blue, green, yellow) along with a sound.</p> 
            <p><b>Player's Turn:</b>The player must repeat the pattern by clicking the colors in the exact same order.</p>
            <p><b>Progression:</b>After each successful attempt, the game adds one more color to the sequence, making it progressively harder.</p>
            <p><b>Mistakes:</b>If the player clicks the wrong color or sequence, the game ends, and the player has to start over (depending on how you implement this).</p>
            <p><b>Difficulty:</b>The sequence continues to get longer as long as the player correctly follows the pattern.</p>
            <p><b>Goal:</b>The aim is to memorize and correctly repeat as long a sequence as possible without making a mistake.</p>
