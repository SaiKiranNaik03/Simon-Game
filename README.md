# Simon Game

The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. As the game progresses, the sequence gets longer, challenging the playerâ€™s memory and reflexes. This game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Four colored buttons:** Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow, each with unique sounds.
- **Random sequence generation:** A new random sequence is created with each round.
- **Interactive gameplay:** Players must repeat the sequence to advance to the next round.
- **Game over:** If the player inputs the wrong sequence, the game ends and can be restarted.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the game interface.
- **CSS:** Handles the visual design, including button styles and animations.
- **JavaScript:** Manages game logic, pattern generation, and player input.

## How to Play

- Press any key to start the game.
- Watch the highlighted sequence of buttons.
- Click the buttons in the same order to repeat the sequence.
- The sequence gets longer after each successful round.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement multiple difficulty levels.
- Provide an option to toggle sound effects on or off.
